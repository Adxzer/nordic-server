# NordicRPG
Official repository for the Minecraft server project named NordicRPG. A full-fledged Minecraft server written in the java framework skript. It includes everything from a core to several systems designed to optimize the server performance. The server has the same features as any other RPG game, as well as over 3500 lines of code and a file size of 700 kb. The project took three months to complete and required me to learn how to code compact systems, which I had never done before.

The core systems are made up of function-based unrepetitive code that is then called out over subfolders with optimization.

It also features an economy market setup that allows you to call an efficient process with 6 rows that creates a shop. This system links a npc to a specific gui where you can take items from a database and insert them when you call the function to have them appear in the shop.

The server was completely developed by me, and I gathered a community of people who were interested in the progress, which was tracked by a github webook to a designated channel.
