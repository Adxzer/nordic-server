I'm afraid you must first demonstrate your worthiness.", "&e[NPC] Alicia: &fKill 10 animals to demonstrate your ability to hunt with your bare hands.", "&e[NPC] Alicia: &fLooks like you don't have enough, go back to killing animals.", "&e[NPC] Alicia: &fWow! That was lightning fast. Take this Common Sword, Shield and these Emeralds. Those should assist you on your upcoming journey; remember to be cautious, and best of luck!", "&e[NPC] Alicia: &fYou appear to be experienced enough, I'm afraid I don't have any more starter items that will help you on your journey")

Skulle du ha något emot att hjälpa mig med att skörda lite vete?", "&e[NPC] Eirik: &fAlltså, du skulle inte stå där som en helt missriktad tonåring och bara stirra på mig om du hade några hyfs.", "&e[NPC] Eirik: &fOh, you don't speak Swedish? Sorry about that then, it's best if you learn at least one of the Nordic languages before continuing your journey. If you don't do that you will have trouble communicating with people, haha.", "&e[NPC] Eirik: &fJokes aside, I'm having difficulty feeding all of the animals around here, and I don't have time to do so while also harvesting wheat.", "&e[NPC] Eirik: &fIf you bring me 192x Wheat, I will gladly reward you with a valuable award that I keep in a chest beneath this farm. That, I believe, will greatly benefit you on your journey.", "&e[NPC] Eirik: &fThat's not enough, bring me some more.", "&e[NPC] Eirik: &fThank you; I can now feed my animals here without difficulty. Hopefully, you mischievous young kids don't go around killing them like you usually do.

I will only give quests to people with whom I can communicate with.")

Although you must exercise caution in this area, there are numerous dangerous monsters that can easily kill you.", "&e[NPC] Uno: &fI've been protecting this village for a while now, but my elderness is catching up with me. As a result, I'm no longer able to protect the village.", "&e[NPC] Uno: &fYou appear to be a strong fighter; perhaps you could help me with some protecting, or in other words, killing.", "&e[NPC] Uno: &fBy deafeating the boos up there you can obtain a Rooted Skin; if you return to me with it, I will reward you with something you might like.", "&e[NPC] Uno: &fI told you what to do, don't make me repeat myself.", "&e[NPC] Uno: &fWell done, fighter, or should I say warrior now?

But, in all honesty, I'd rather relax and spend time scavenging, which is my hobby.", "&e[NPC] Bjarne: &fHere's the thing, I'm attempting to construct a new super shovel capable of digging deep into the ground. The issue is that I'm missing one component. I've been looking for years.

Wow, this is the best day of my life; maybe I'll be able to get that mysterious item and make my super shovel then!", "&e[NPC] Bjarne: &fNope, that doesn't look like the item that I'm searching for.", "&e[NPC] Bjarne: &fOh my goodness!! YESSS! YOU FOUND IT! THANK YOU! I adore you! Take all of my money as a reward; I won't need it now anyway.", "&e[NPC] Bjarne: &fTake a look at my super shovel.

Best of luck.", "&e[NPC] Dalur: &fThat doesn't look like the golden carrot I'm looking for.", "&e[NPC] Dalur: &fIs that... OH MY GOD, THAT'S SO SHINY. Take my savings and leave...
