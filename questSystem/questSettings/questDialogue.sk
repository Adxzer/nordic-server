I see you are new here, and I believe you might benefit from one of my starter items.", "&e[NPC] Alicia: &fI usually give these starter items to new travelers to help them get started on their dangerous journey.", "&e[NPC] Alicia: &fBut do not expect me to give you this item for free. I am afraid you must first demonstrate your worthiness.", "&e[NPC] Alicia: &fKill 10 animals to demonstrate your ability to hunt with your bare hands.", "&e[NPC] Alicia: &fLooks like you don't have enough, go back to killing animals.", "&e[NPC] Alicia: &fWow! That was lightning fast. Take this Common Sword and these Emeralds. Those should assist you on your upcoming journey; remember to be cautious, and best of luck!", "&e[NPC] Alicia: &fYou appear to be experienced enough, I'm afraid I do not have any more starter items that will help you on your journey")

Skulle du ha något emot att hjälpa mig med att skörda lite vete?", "&e[NPC] Eirik: &fAlltså, du skulle inte stå där som en helt missriktad tonåring och bara stirra på mig om du hade några hyfs.", "&e[NPC] Eirik: &fOh, you do not speak Swedish? Sorry about that then, it is best if you learn at least one of the Nordic languages before continuing your journey. If you do not do that you will have trouble communicating with people, haha.", "&e[NPC] Eirik: &fJokes aside, I am having difficulty feeding all of the animals around here, and I do not have time to do so while also harvesting wheat.", "&e[NPC] Eirik: &fIf you bring me 192x Wheat, I will gladly reward you with a valuable award that I keep in a chest beneath this farm. That, I believe, will greatly benefit you on your journey.", "&e[NPC] Eirik: &fThat's not enough, bring me some more.", "&e[NPC] Eirik: &fThank you; I can now feed my animals here without difficulty. Hopefully, you mischievous young kids do not go around killing them like you usually do. Take this Beginners Hoe, it will double and increase your stats from harvesting wheat.", "&e[NPC] Eirik: &fHave you begun studying Swedish yet? I will only give quests to people with whom I can communicate with.")
